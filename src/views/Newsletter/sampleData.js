export default '<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong>VILLAS VOICE&nbsp;</strong></h2><h3 style="text-align:center;"><strong>May 2020&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>I think that I am safe in saying that this has been one of the most unusual and stressful months that most of us have ever experienced. I personally know of 2 people who have relatives in their late 80’s, one has an aunt and one has a sister in an assisted living center. Thankfully neither one of them have contracted the virus yet but still, not being able to go see them and be with them is causing a tremendous amount of stress and grief in their life. I sincerely hope that none of you are in this type of situation.</p><p>Today I received authorization to open up the pool to the residents but with some very stringent guidelines, but sadly the clubhouse must remain closed. As you all know, Freddy is not here all day long and into the evening so the pool has to be treated as an un-supervised facility meaning that we can’t have any chairs or lounges at the pool. You can bring your own chair to use but make sure that you take it home with you when you leave. The restrooms will also have a spray bottle of disinfectant in each so if you use the facilities PLEASE disinfect the restroom when you are done, leaving it clean and sanitized for the next person. I will post a copy of the document that I received; Broward County has issued Emergency Order 20-08 (<a href="https://www.broward.org/CoronaVirus/Documents/Emergency%20Order%2020-06.pdf">https://www.broward.org/CoronaVirus/Documents/Emergency%20Order%2020-06.pdf</a>) on the bulletin board if anybody is interested in reading it.</p><p>Freddy has been working very hard on beautifying the grounds and entrance ways. Three generous ladies have been so kind as to donate a number of plants and flowers to Freddy for him to use in the beautification process. These ladies are Mery Jiménez, Maritza Ramirez &amp; Carmen Edler. Because of the virus problem we had to cancel the monthly Board meeting and the General Membership meeting. April and May are 2 very important month in our election process. At the April General Membership meeting we receive the nominations for the board positions that will be opened after their 2 year term is completed, then in May we have our Election meeting where every owner in VOAP has an opportunity to vote for the individuals that they select from those nominated or write in the name of a person that wasn’t previously nominated. In effect this whole process has been moved out one month meaning the monthly Board meeting will be held on May 11th 7:30 PM, the General Membership meeting for the nominations to the board will be held on May 20th at 8:00 PM and Elections meeting will be held on June 17th at 8:00 PM. Last year we came within $100 of our budget projection and believe me that was no small task. Each and every board member spent a lot of effort towards pulling that off. For many years we have had a very active and dedicated board, so it is up to YOU the owners here in the Villas of Arista Park to nominate and elect the people you want on the board keep the successful process rolling.</p><p>On a final point but still a rather important one, I have heard from a number of sources that during this outbreak you shouldn’t use ibuprofen for your fever or discomfort. They say that this drives the infection into your lungs and causes pneumonia. It is recommended to use Tylenol or Acetaminophen instead. I personally can’t vouch for the validity of this but I personally don’t see a point in taking a chance.&nbsp;</p><p>Have a safe and healthy May</p><p><strong>Respectfully,</strong></p><p><strong>Gary Edler</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class="table"><table><tbody><tr><td>Gary Edler, President</td><td>(555) 555-5555</td><td rowspan="10"><p>Luxe Property Services</p><p>2151 W.
